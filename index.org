**** Difference btween safety and sustainability:
R. Westrum and P.T.W. Hudson modeled "Safety Ladder" of 5 steps for corporate to reach #safety maturity, applying same model to #sustainability ladder as in figure.
One difference is that safety will tend to develop its own specific systems, processes, and tools while sustainability will tend to ride on existing processes and borrow proven tools.
So the question is; will sustainability concepts bring safety (including #health and #environment) below its wing?
